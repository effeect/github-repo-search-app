# Github Repo Search Project

The following tools were used :

- React Router - To allow basic searching of code within the repository
- Octokit
- PureCSS as a starting point for CSS stuff. Would use Tailwind/Bulma for a bigger project however the word "small" is important for this project in my personal opinion. Much easier to move a smaller ship as they say...

IDE/Tools for code formatting :

- Prettier

# Features

- Ability to search for repos and sort and add rules
- Ability to search for code and view individual files within the GUI
